Q: How to train a model?
A: You need to first edit the json format config file. For test purpose, you can use sample_config.json.
   Secondly, create direction {current_workspace}/data/model/.
   You can launch a training by using command "python main.py [config_file_name]". Model will be saved to ./data/model/.
